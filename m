KdNet is the one setting the SIMP and it's not setting the SCONTROL, ill 
paste output of KVM traces for the relevant MSRs

I guess there is something I'm missing here but let's say the BIOS would 
have set the SCONTROL but the OS is not setting it, who is in charge of 
handling the interrupts?

I tried testing with both the SeaBIOS branch you have suggested and the 
EDK2, unfortunately I could not get the EDK2 build to identify my VM 
drive to boot from (not sure why)

Here is an output of KVM trace for the relevant MSRs (SCONTROL and SIMP)

  I could not get the EDK2 setup to work though
  (https://src.openvz.org/projects/UP/repos/edk2 branch hv-scsi)

It does not detect my VM hard drive not sure why (this is how i  
configured it:
  -drive file=./win10.qcow2,format=qcow2,if=none,id=drive_disk0 \
  -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=drive_disk0 \

(Is there something special i need to configure it order for it to 
  work?, I tried building EDK2 with and without SMM_REQUIRE and 
  SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE)


But in general it sounds like there is something I dont fully 
understand when SCONTROL is enabled, then a GSI is associated with this 
SintRoute.

Then when the guest triggers an EOI via the APIC we will trigger the GSI 
notification, which will give us another go on trying to copy the 
message into it's slot.

So is it the OS that is in charge of setting the EOI? If so then it 
needs to be aware of SCONTROL being enabled and just having it left set 
by the BIOS might not be enough?

Also in the TLFS (looking at v6) they mention that message queueing has 
"3 exit conditions", which will cause the hypervisor to try and attempt 
to deliver the additional messages.

The 3 exit conditions they refer to are:
* Another message buffer is queued.
* The guest indicates the “end of interrupt” by writing to the APIC’s 
   EOI register.
* The guest indicates the “end of message” by writing to the SynIC’s EOM 
   register.

Also notice this additional exit is only if there is a pending message 
and not for every EOM.

Thanks,
-- Jon.
