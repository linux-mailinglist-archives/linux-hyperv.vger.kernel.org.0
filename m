We're talking about nested VMX, i.e. exposing TSC_SCALING to L1.  QEMU's CLX
definition doesn't include TSC_SCALING.  In fact, none of QEMU's predefined CPU
models supports TSC_SCALING, precisely because KVM didn't support exposing the
feature to L1 until relatively recently.

$ git grep VMX_SECONDARY_EXEC_TSC_SCALING
target/i386/cpu.h:#define VMX_SECONDARY_EXEC_TSC_SCALING              0x02000000
target/i386/kvm/kvm.c:    if (f[FEAT_VMX_SECONDARY_CTLS] & VMX_SECONDARY_EXEC_TSC_SCALING) {

Ah, I see what you're worried about.  Your concern is that QEMU will add a VMX
feature to a predefined CPU model, but only later gain eVMCS support, and so
"CascadeLake-Server,hv-evmcs" will do different things depending on the KVM
version.

But again, that's already reality.  Run "-cpu CascadeLake-Server" against a KVM
from before commits:

  28c1c9fabf48 ("KVM/VMX: Emulate MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES")
  1eaafe91a0df ("kvm: x86: IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES is always supported")

and it will fail.  There are undoubtedly many other features that are similarly
affected, just go back far enough in KVM time.

Or simply run "-cpu CascadeLake-Server" on pre-CLX hardware.  Anything that KVM
doesn't fully emulate will not be present.

Yes, and if KVM doesn't support features that CascadeLake-Server requires, spawning
the VM will fail on the destination, as it should.  My point is that this behavior
is not unique to eVMCS.

QEMU/Libvirt must also be prepared for rejection, because it is flat out impossible
to ensure that KVM+hardware supports a specific feature.

Because it's completely unnecessary, adds non-trivial maintenance burden to KVM,
and requires explicit documentation to explain to userspace what "hv-evmcs-2022"
means.

It's unnecessary because if the user is concerned about eVMCS features showing up
in the future, then they should do:

  -cpu CascadeLake-Server,hv-evmcs,-vmx-tsc-scaling,-<any other VMX features not eVMCS-friendly>

If QEMU wants to make that more user friendly, then define CascadeLake-Server-eVMCS
or whatever so that the features that are unlikely be supported for eVMCS are off by
default.  This is no different than QEMU not including nested TSC_SCALING in any of
the predefined models; the developers _know_ KVM doesn't widely support TSC_SCALING,
so it was omitted, even though a real CLX CPU is guaranteed to support TSC_SCALING.

It's non-trivial maintenance for KVM because it would require defining new versions
every time an eVMCS field is added, allowing userspace to specify and restrict
features based on arbitrary versions, and do all of that without conflicting with
whatever PV enumeration Microsoft adds.
