Well I did further look into this now and it seems like the e1000e 
should work did find a recent case which indicates there was an issue 
until not too long ago:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1787142

I'll try to bring up a setup with the latest Win10 and see if I can 
configure it for kernel debugging via e1000e nic.
