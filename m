For the benefit of others here, SMCCCv1.2 allows:

* SMC64/HVC64 to use all of x1-x17 for both parameters and return values
* SMC32/HVC32 to use all of r1-r7 for both parameters and return values

The rationale for this was to make it possible to pass a large number of
arguments in one call without the hypervisor/firmware needing to access
the memory of the caller.

My preference would be to add arm_smccc_1_2_{hvc,smc}() assembly
functions which read all the permitted argument registers from a struct,
and write all the permitted result registers to a struct, leaving it to
callers to set those up and decompose them.

That way we only have to write one implementation that all callers can
use, which'll be far easier to maintain. I suspect that in general the
cost of temporarily bouncing the values through memory will be dominated
by whatever the hypervisor/firmware is going to do, and if it's not we
can optimize that away in future.

As above, something of this sort would be my preferred approach.

Thanks,
Mark.
