Right my bad :( if you want I can re-run the test with the others as

Hi Roman,

So based on your answer I got to the following conclusions (correct if 
they are wrong).

First of the one in charge of setting the SCONTROL in the 1st place is 
the BIOS (I dont have a real Hyper-V setup so I cannot really debug it 
and see, not sure which BIOS they have or if we can "rip" it out and run 
it through KVM and see how things look like this way).

If the BIOS has not set the SCONTROL I would expect the OS to have 
something along the lines:
if (!(get_scontrol() & ENABLED))
     set_scontrol(ENABLED);

So I started looking through the entire Windows system looking what can 
set SCONTROL, I believe I have found the flow to be the following:

VMBus.sys imports winhv.sys (which is an export library) winhv.sys will 
set the SCONTROL prior to VMBus DriverEntry starting here is the 
complete flow:
winhv!DllInitialize -> winhv!WinHvpInitialize -> 
winhv!WinHvReportPresentHypervisor -> winhv!WinHvpConnectToSynic -> 
winhv!WinHvpEnableSynic

Eventually WinHvpEnableSynic will simply set SCONTROL (for future 
reference if anyone needs to look into how HyperV register access works 
in Windows it seems like there is an enum representing all the HyperV 
registers and to access it there are helper functions to Get/Set.
SCONTROL value in the enum is 0x0a0010 .

winhv.sys simply provides very simple API to access the Sints i.e 
(WinHvSetSint / WinHvSetEndOfMessage / WinHvSetSintOnCurrentProcessor / 
  WinHvGetSintMessage / etc.)

So basically it seems like the OS does not really care if the BIOS has 
setup the SCONTROL or not, and does so always (if it can) unfortunately 
in my flow (via kdnet) VMBus is not loaded yet and so does winhv.sys so 
they "fallback" into this Polling mode.

So that covers the OS part, after that I have tried looking for relevant 
code in bootmgr and winload (which are Windows boot loader part (like 
grub) and I could not find any code that might setup SCONTROL.

 From your experience with this did you see Hyper-V BIOS simply setting 
the SCONTROL? Perhaps if that's the case then the correct fix needs to 
be in the SeaBIOS and the EDK .

I tried to see if Hyper-V supports giving it a BIOS but could not find 
anyway of doing this, so it just might be that Hyper-V assumes the BIOS 
is in charge of setting up SCONTROL for all the boot loader components.

But in a way it sounds weird because I would expect to see KDNet working 
with the ACPI to trigger the GSI but I could not find any relevant code 
that might do that.

As I write this I think I'm starting to get your point just to make sure 
I understand it:

1. When a new SintRoute is created we associate it with a GSI
2. When an EOM is set, we trigger all the GSIs so QEMU will get 
    execution time and send all pending messages if it can.

So basically like you said everything "works" from our perspective 
regardless if the system has setup SCONTROL or not, because you trigger 
the interrupt to QEMU regardless of SCONTROL so it can clear the pending 
message.

If that's indeed the case then probably the only thing needs fixing in 
my scenario is in QEMU where it should not really care for the SCONTROL 
if it's enabled or not.

Sounds about right?

Thanks,
-- Jon.
