Sure. Want to try running some benchmarks on that platform?
Presumably you have access to such a box, right?

I don't see how this matters for any applications at all. Feel free to
present a case that would be race free with a word but not a 16
byte value, I could not imagine one. It's human to err of course.

I think this hinges on benchmarking results. Want to start with
my silly benchmark at least? If you can't measure an order of
magnitude gain then I think any effect on wireguard will be in the
noise.

I think it would begin with a benchmark showing there's even any
measureable performance to be gained by switching the semantics.

Right but given you are trading security off for performance, it matters
a lot what the performance gain is.
