SCONTROL doesn't enable the interrupts, it enables SynIC as a whole.
The interrupts are enabled via individual SINTx msrs.  This SeaBIOS
branch does exactly this: it enables the SynIC via SCONTROL, and then
specific SynIC functionality via SIMP/SIEFP, but doesn't activate SINTx
and works in polling mode.

I agree that this global SCONTROL switch seems redundant but it appears
to match the spec.

I guess this is a bit misplaced timewise, BIOS is still working here

BIOS sets up message page

BIOS clears message page (it's not needed once the VMBus device was
brought up)

I guess the choice of Windows DebugEntry appeared somewhere here.

Bootloader (debug stub?) sets up the message page

Message page is being disabled again.

I guess you only filtered SCONTROL and SIMP, skipping e.g. SVERSION,
GUEST_OS_ID, HYPERCALL, etc., which are also part of the exchange here.

No special configuration I can think of.

Right.

Yes.

Yes it needs to be aware of SCONTROL being enabled.  However, this
awareness may be based on a pure assumption that the previous entity
(BIOS or bootloader) did it already.

This meaning of "exit" doesn't trivially correspond to what we have in
KVM.  A write to an msr does cause a vmexit.  Then KVM notifies resample
eventfds for all SINTs that have them set up, no matter if there's a
pending message in the slot.  It may be slightly more optimal to only
notify those having indicated a pending message, but I don't see the
current behavior break anything or violate the spec, so, as EOMs are not
used on fast paths, I woudn't bother optimizing.
