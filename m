I'm having a hard time figuring out what's different between your
statement and mine. I said that the race is due to the notification.
You said that the race is due to the notification. What subtle thing
am I missing here that would lead you to say that my assumption is
incorrect? Or did you just misread?

Right. But more than just transactions, it's useful to preventing key
reuse vulnerabilities, in which case, you store the current identifier
just before an ephemeral key is generated, and then subsequently check
to see that the identifier hasn't changed before transmitting anything
related to that key.

Yes, as mentioned and discussed in depth before. However, your use of
the word "counter" is problematic. Vmgenid is not a counter. It's a
unique identifier. That means you can't compare it with a single word
comparison but have to compare all of the 16 bytes. That seems
potentially expensive. It's for that reason that I suggested
augmenting the vmgenid spec with an additional word-sized _counter_
that could be mapped into the kernels and into userspaces.

Right.

Were it a single word-sized integer, mapped into memory, that wouldn't
be much of a problem at all. It could constantly read this before and
after every operation. The problem is that it's 16 bytes and
understandably applications don't want to deal with that clunkiness.

Actually, no, you need even less than that. All that's required is a
sysfs/procfs file that can be poll()'d on. It doesn't need to have any
content. When poll() returns readable, the VM has been forked. Then
userspace rngs and other things like that can call getrandom() to
receive a fresh value to mix into whatever their operation is. Since
all we're talking about here is _event notification_, all we need is
that event, which is what poll() provides.

Yes. poll() can do this. For the purposes of discussion, I've posted
an implementation of this idea here:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220309215907.77526-1-Jason@zx2c4.com/

What I'm sort of leaning toward is doing something like that patch,
and then later if vmgenid ever grows an additional word-sized counter,
moving to explore the race-free approach. Given the amount of
programming required to actually implement the race-free approach
(transactions and careful study of each case), the poll() file
approach might be a medium-grade compromise for the time being.
Evidently that's what Microsoft decided too.
