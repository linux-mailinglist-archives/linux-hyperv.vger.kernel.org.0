That's good to hear!

One potential issue worth noting is that as those pieces of software are
unlikely to handle counter frequency changes reliably, and so may not
behave correctly if live-migrated.

Yes.

In addition, there are a larger set of things necessarily exposed to VMs
that mean that live migration isn't all that practical except betweenm
identical machines (where the counter frequency should be identical),
and the timer frequency might just be the canary in the coalmine. For
example, the cache properties enumerated in CTR_EL0 cannot necessarily
be emulated on another machine.

Thanks for chasing this up!
