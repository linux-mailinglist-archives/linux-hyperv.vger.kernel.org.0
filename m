OK, but I think we do have to cope with the fact that the limit is dynamic=
, and a CPU might be added which widens the mask=2E I think that's fundamen=

The x86_non_ir_mask isn't intended to be directly exposed to any generic I=
RQ code=2E

It's set up by the x86 APIC code so that those x86 IRQ domains which are a=
ffected by it, can set it with irqdomain_set_max_affinity() for the generic=
 code to see=2E Without each having to create the cpumask from scratch for =
themselves=2E

I don't actually like that very much=2E The IRQ remapping code could just =
compose the MSI messages that it desires without really having to care so m=
uch about the child device=2E The bit where IRQ remapping actually composes=
 IOAPIC RTEs makes me particularly sad=2E
