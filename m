Word-size reads happen all at once on systems that Linux supports,
whereas this is not the case for 16 bytes (with a few niche exceptions
like cmpxchg16b and such). If you read the counter atomically, you can
check to see whether it's changed just after encrypting but before
transmitting and not transmit if it has changed, and voila, no race.
With 16 bytes, synchronization of that read is pretty tricky (though
maybe not all together impossible), because, as I mentioned, the first
word might have changed by the time you read a matching second word. I'm
sure you're familiar with the use of seqlocks in the kernel for solving
a somewhat related problem.
