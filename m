All this matches VSM's expectations to how interrupts are to be handled.
But APIC groups is a concept we created with the aim of generalizing the
behaviour as much as possible.

There are three tricks to APIC groups. One is IPI routing: for ex. the
ICR phyical destination is mixed with the source vCPU's APIC group to
find the destination vCPU. Another is presenting a coherent APIC ID
across VTLs; switching VTLs shouldn't change the guest's view of the
APIC ID. And ultimately keeps track of the vCPU's VTL level. I don't wee
why we couldn't decouple them, as long as we keep filtering the APIC ID
before it reaches the guest.

Sorry, I've been actively trying to avoid pronouns as you already
mentioned it on a previous review. This one made it through the cracks.

I left a note about this in my reply to your questions in the cover

Yes, although I'm under the impression that no sane OS will do so. We
can decouple the group from the APIC ID, but it still needs to be masked
before presenting it to the guest. So I guess we'll have to deal with
the eventuality of apic id writing one way or anoter (a warn only if VSM
is enabled?).

If we decide the APIC group uAPI is not worth it, we can always create
an ad-hoc VSM one that explicitly sets the kvm_vcpu's VTL. Then route
the VTL internally into the APIC which can use still groups (or a
similar concept).
