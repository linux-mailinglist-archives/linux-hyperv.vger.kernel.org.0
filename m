I think with /proc/net/vsock_cid_outside, instead of disallowing the CID
from being used, this could be solved by disallowing remapping the CID
while in use?

The thing I like about this is that users can check
/proc/net/vsock_cid_outside to figure out what might be going on,
instead of trying to check lsof or ps to figure out if the VMM processes
have used /dev/vhost-vsock vs /dev/vhost-vsock-netns.

Just to check I am following... I suppose we would have a few typical
configurations for /proc/net/vsock_cid_outside. Following uid_map file
format of:
	"<local cid start>		<global cid start>		<range size>"

	1. Identity mapping, current namespace CID is global CID (default
	setting for new namespaces):

		# empty file

				OR

		0    0    4294967295

	2. Complete isolation from global space (initialized, but no mappings):

		0    0    0

	3. Mapping in ranges of global CIDs

	For example, global CID space starts at 7000, up to 32-bit max:

		7000    0    4294960295
	
	Or for multiple mappings (0-100 map to 7000-7100, 1000-1100 map to
	8000-8100) :

		7000    0       100
		8000    1000    100


One thing I don't love is that option 3 seems to not be addressing a
known use case. It doesn't necessarily hurt to have, but it will add
complexity to CID handling that might never get used?

Since options 1/2 could also be represented by a boolean (yes/no
"current ns shares CID with global"), I wonder if we could either A)
only support the first two options at first, or B) add just
/proc/net/vsock_ns_mode at first, which supports only "global" and
"local", and later add a "mapped" mode plus /proc/net/vsock_cid_outside
or the full mapping if the need arises?

This could also be how we support Option 2 from Stefano's last email of
supporting per-namespace opt-in/opt-out.

Any thoughts on this?

Agreed, I do like the plainness of reasoning through it.

Thanks!
