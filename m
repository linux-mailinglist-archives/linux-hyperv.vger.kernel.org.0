Many existing userspace drivers are unsafe:
  - out of tree DPDK igb_uio is unsafe.
  - VFIO with noiommu is unsafe.
  - hv_uio_generic is unsafe.

This new driver is not any better or worse. This sounds like a complete
repeat of the discussion that occurred before introducing VFIO noiommu mode.

Shouldn't vmbus vfio taint the kernel in the same way as vfio noiommu does?
