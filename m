I think the file path is global but the contents are tied per-namespace,
according to the namespace of the process that called open() on it.
This way the container mgr can write-once lock it, and the namespace
processes can read it?

Sounds like a plan! I'm working on the new vsock vmtest now and will
include the new tests in the next rev.

Also, I'm thinking we should protect vsock_cid_map behind a capability,
but I'm not sure which one is correct (CAP_NET_ADMIN?). WDYT?

Thanks!
