Agree, this is our goal.

Sure. We need to find a generic-enough KVM interface to be able to
restrict a wide range of virtualization/hardware mechanisms (to not rely
too much on KVM changes) and delegate most of enforcement/emulation to
VTL1.  In short, policy definition owned by VTL0/guest, and policy
enforcement shared between KVM (coarse grained) and VTL1 (fine grained).

Yes, that was our concern too and another reason why we choose to let
the guest handle its own security policy.

I'm not sure to understand why "Heki not having a complete story".  The
goal is the same as the current kernel self-protection mechanisms.
