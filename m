Why is it out of tree?

Which taints the kernel and requires raw I/O user privs.

Gosh, it's pretty coy about this, no kernel tainting, no user
capability tests, no scary dmesg or Kconfig warnings.  Do users know
it's unsafe?

Yes, the no-iommu interaction happens at the vfio-core level.  I can't
speak for any of the uio interfaces you mention, but I know that
uio_pci_generic is explicitly intended for non-DMA use cases and in
fact the efforts to enable MSI/X support in that driver and the
objections raised for breaking that usage model by the maintainer, is
what triggered no-iommu support for vfio.  IIRC, the rationale was
largely for code reuse both at the kernel and userspace driver level,
while imposing a minimal burden in vfio-core for this dummy iommu
driver.  vfio explicitly does not provide a DMA mapping solution for
no-iommu use cases because I'm not willing to maintain any more lines
of code to support this usage model.  The tainting imposed by this model
and incomplete API was intended to be a big warning to discourage its
use and as features like vIOMMU become more prevalent and bare metal
platforms without physical IOMMUs hopefully become less prevalent,
maybe no-iommu could be phased out or removed.

You might consider this a re-hashing of those previous discussions, but
to me it seems like taking advantage of and promoting an interface that
should have plenty of warning signs that this is not a safe way to use
the device from userspace.  Without some way to take advantage of the
code in a safe way, this just seems to be normalizing an unsupportable
usage model.  Thanks,

Alex
