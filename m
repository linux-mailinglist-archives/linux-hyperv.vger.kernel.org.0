I can at least say that this breakdown makes sense to me. Traditional
memory hotplug results in permanent change to the raw firmware memory
map reported by the host at next reboot. These device-driver-owned
memory regions really want a hotplug policy per-kernel boot instance
and should fall back to the default reserved state at reboot (kexec or
otherwise). When I say hotplug-policy I mean whether the current
kernel wants to treat the device range as System RAM or leave it as
device-managed. The intent is that the follow-on kernel needs to
re-decide the device policy.
