Dxgkrnl creates a single user mode visible device node /dev/dxg. It has
nothing to do with a specific hardware compute device on the host. Its
purpose is to provide services (IOCTLs) to enumerate and manage virtual
compute devices, which represent hardware devices on the host. The VMBus
devices are not used directly by user mode clients in the current design.

Virtual compute devices are shared between processes. There could be a
Cuda application, Gimp and a Direct3D12 application working at the same
time.This is what I mean by saying that there are multiple user mode
clients who use the /dev/dxg driver interface. Each of this applications
will open the /dev/dxg device node and enumerate/use virtual compute
devices.

If we change the way how the virtual compute devices are visible to user
mode, the Cuda runtime, Direct3D runtime would need to be changed.

I think we agreed that I will keep the global driver state in the device
object as Wei suggested and remove global variables. There still will be
a single /dev/dxg device node. Correct?


Thanks
