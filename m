From my POV a decision between a unified approach and interim solutions
in upstream should usually be resolved in favor of the former.
Given there are different stake holders in VTL code integration, I'd
suggest we step back a bit and think about how to proceed with the
overall design.

In my opinion, although I undestand why Underhill project decided to
come up with the original VTL kernels separation during build time, it's
time to reconsider this approach and to come up with a more generic
design, supporting booting the same kernel in different VTLs.

The major reason for this is that LVBS project relies on binary
compatibility of the kernels running in different VTLs.
The simplest way to provide such a guarantee in both development and
deployment is to run the same kernel in both VTLs.
Not having this ability will require carefull crafting of both the
kernels upon build, making kexec servicing of such kernels in production
complicated and error prone.

Thanks,
Stas
