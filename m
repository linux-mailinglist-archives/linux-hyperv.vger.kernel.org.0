Just to be clear, the vDSO is *one example* of something that won't
function correctly. More generally, because this undermines core
architectural guarantees, it requires more invasive changes (e.g. we'd
have to weaken the sanity checks, and not use the counter in things like
kexec paths), impacts any architectural features tied to the generic
timer/counter (e.g. the event stream, SPE and tracing, future features),
and means that other SW (e.g. bootloaders and other EFI applications)
are unlikley to function correctly in this environment.

I am very much not keen on trying to PV this.

What does the guest see when it reads CNTFRQ_EL0? Does this match the
real HW value (and can this change over time)? Or is this entirely
synthetic?

What do the ACPI tables look like in the guest? Is there a GTDT table at
all?

How does the counter event stream behave?

Are there other architectural features which Hyper-V does not implement
for a guest?

Is there anything else that may change across a migration? e.g. MIDR?
MPIDR? Any of the ID registers?

I think that is rather unfortunate, given it's a core architectural
feature. Is it just the interrupt that's missing? i.e. does all the
PE-local functionality behave as the architecture requires?

Thanks,
Mark.
