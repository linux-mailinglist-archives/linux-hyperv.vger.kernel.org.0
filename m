As I told you before: Your ordering is wrong. We do not introduce bugs
first and then fix them later ....

Errm what?

The MSI domain does not know anything about what the underlying domain
can handle and it shouldn't.

If MSI is on top of remapping then the remapping domain defines what the
MSI domain can do and not the other way round. Ditto for the non
remapped case in which the vector domain decides.

The top most MSI irq chip does not even have a compose function, neither
for the remap nor for the vector case. The composition is done by the
parent domain from the data which the parent domain constructed. Same
for the IO/APIC just less clearly separated.

The top most chip just takes what the underlying domain constructed and
writes it to the message store, because that's what the top most chip
controls. It does not control the content.
