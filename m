Laszlo just asked the same question, which I answered here:
<https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Yh5JwK6toc%2FzBNL7@zx2c4.com/>. You have
to read the full 16 bytes. You can't safely just read the first 4 or 8
or something, because it's a "unique ID" rather than a counter. That
seems like a needlessly expensive thing to do on each-and-every packet.

I don't really understand your question, but guessing your meaning: I'm
not talking about exposing the actual 16-byte value to any other
drivers, but just notifying them that their sessions should be dropped.
If it's easier to think about this in code, grep for wg_pm_notification(),
and consider that it'd be changing this code:

        if (action != PM_HIBERNATION_PREPARE && action != PM_SUSPEND_PREPARE)
                return 0;

into:

        if (action != PM_HIBERNATION_PREPARE && action != PM_SUSPEND_PREPARE &&
	    action != PM_VMFORK_POST)
                return 0;

But perhaps I misunderstood this part of your question?

Jason
