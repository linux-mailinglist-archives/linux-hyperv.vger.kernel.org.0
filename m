For all the same reasons userspace wants to know what hardware features are
supported by hardware and KVM.

But users will inevitably want to know exactly what features a platform supports
for a given configuration.  E.g. if KVM only supported pre-configured CPU models,
KVM would need to document what features are supported by each model, and userspace
would have very little flexibility in terms of what features are exposed to the
guest.  That's an exaggerated example as there are far more CPUID features than
eVMCS features, but it's the same underlying concept.

But userspace already has to deal with that complexity in raw VMX MSRs.  The
filtered values will always be a subset of the unfiltered values, so if eVMCS
will be exposed to the guest, userspace can simply treat the filtered set as the
baseline supported set, i.e. the userspace logic could simply be:

	if (expose_evmcs)
		get_evmcs_vmx_msrs(&msrs);
	else
		get_vmx_msrs(&msrs);


Userspace will need to take on more complexity if userspace wants to expose features
that are supported in hardware but not with eVMCS active, but I don't see the point
in doing so because AFAICT KVM will just override and filter the VMX MSRs anyways
when eVMCS is enabled, i.e. userspace _can't_ expose the unfiltered VMX MSRs to the
guest when eVMCS is enabled.

If there's a CPUID feature bit, why does KVM need to invent its own revision scheme?
