All this makes perfect sense to me.  Unfortunately it's hard to reason
about the supposed interaction of the components when all you have at
hand are opensource guests on Hyper-V and Windows on an opensource
hypervisor.

E.g. the SeaBIOS code contains a kludge to disable SIMP as soon as vmbus
setup and device enumeration is complete, because otherwise Windows 2016
skips activating the message page, and the hypervisor happily writes to
the stale message page set up by the BIOS.

I didn't manage to get Hyper-V load a custom BIOS myself.  However I
think you should be able to tell the state the MSRs are left in by the
BIOS on Hyper-V with a custom Linux that would log it prior to
adjusting.  I don't have ready access to a Hyper-V machine so can't help
here.

To the best of my knowledge SINTs aren't registered with ACPI.

Right

It's in the opposite direction: when EOM is written by the guest, this
triggers the resampler eventfds associated with the GSIs.  As a result,
QEMU gets notified and may retry posting respective messages.  But yes,
the general idea is right.

This is how it works in KVM, indeed.

Right.  However, even this shouldn't be necessary as SeaBIOS from that
branch would enable SCONTROL and leave it that way when passing the
control over to the bootloader, so, unless something explicitly clears
SCONTROL, it should remain set thereafter.  I'd rather try going ahead
with that scheme first, because making QEMU ignore SCONTROL appears to
violate the spec.
