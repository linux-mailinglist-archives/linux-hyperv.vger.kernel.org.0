I under where you are coming from in the idea of leaving it to the OS 
but I think in this specific case it does not make much sense, after all 
HyperV has it's own proprietary BIOS which Windows assumes has setup 
some of the MSRs, since we dont have that BIOS we need to "emulate" it's 
behaviour.

I also feel like the best approach should be in QEMU in case VMBus 
device exists it will also setup the SCONTROL to ENABLED, this way you 
are not bound to have a special BIOS in case you have decided to use 
HyperV advanced features like VMBus.

Cheers,
