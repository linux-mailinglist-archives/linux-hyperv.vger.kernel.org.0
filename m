As I wrote a good deal of that code I hope I should be able to help (and
I'd be interested, too).  How exactly does the "not working" look like?

Also I'm a bit confused as to why UEFI is critical for the work you're
doing?  Can't it be made to work with BIOS first?

I do, as I'm probably the only one who could have submitted them :)

No they were not submitted.  Neither were the ones for SeaBIOS nor iPXE.
The reason was that I had found no way to use alternative firmware with
HyperV, so the only environment where that would be useful and testable
was QEMU with VMBus.  Therefore I thought it made no sense to submit
them until VMBus landed in QEMU.

Thanks,
Roman.
