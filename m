I'm obviously missing something. "-cpu CascadeLake-Sever" presumes
cetain features, including VMX features (e.g. TSC_SCALING), an attempt
to create such vCPU on a CPU which doesn't support it will lead to
immediate failure. So two VMs created on different hosts with

-cpu CascadeLake-Sever

are guaranteed to look exactly the same from guest PoV. This is not true
for '-cpu CascadeLake-Sever,hv-evmcs' (if we do it the way you suggest)
as 'hv-evmcs' will be a *different* filter on each host (which is going
to depend on KVM version, not even on the host's hardware).

I don't think we have this problem for VMX features as named CPU models
in QEMU encode all of them explicitly, they *must* be present whenever
such vCPU is created.

Why? Something like 

"-cpu CascadeLake-Sever,hv-evmcs,hv-evmcs-2022,-vmx-tsc-scaling" 

should work well, no? 'hv-evmcs*' are just filters, if the VMX feature
is not there -- it's not there.

We can certainly make this fine-grained and introduce
KVM_CAP_HYPERV_EVMCS_TSC_SCALING instead and make a 'hv-*' flag for it,
however, with Hyper-V and Windows I really don't like 'frankenstein'
Hyper-V configurations which look nothing like genuine Hyper-V as nobody
at Microsoft tests new Windows builds with such configurations. And yes,
bugs were discovered in the past (e.g. PerfGlobalCtrl and Win11).
