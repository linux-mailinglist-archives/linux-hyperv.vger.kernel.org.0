Well if you dont have SCONTROL and a GSI associated with the SINT then 
it does not...

That's what I was thinking originally as well, but then i noticed KDNET 
as a VMBus client (and it basically runs before anything else) is 
working in this polling mode, where SCONTROL is disabled and it just 
loops, and if it saw there is a PENDING message flag it will issue an 
EOM to indicate it has free the slot.
(There are a bunch of patches i sent on the QEMU mailing list as well 
  where i CCed you, I will probably revise it a bit but was hoping to get 
  KVM sorted out first).

Cheers,
