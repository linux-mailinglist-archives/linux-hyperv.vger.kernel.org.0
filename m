AIUI, if the firmware has programmed the BAR addresses, Linux will
generally try to leave them alone, it's only unprogrammed devices or
when using the pci=realloc option that we'll try to shuffle things
around.

If you talk to bare metal system firmware developers, you might find
disagreement regarding whether the OS or system firmware owns the
device address space, which I believe also factors into our handling of
the memory space enable bit of the command register.  Minimally, system
firmware is required to allocate resources and enable boot devices, and
often these are left enabled after the hand-off to the OS.  This might
include some peripherals, for instance legacy emulation on a USB
keyboard might leave the USB host controller enabled.  There are also
more devious use cases, where there might be device monitoring running
across the bus under the OS, perhaps via SMI or other means, where if
we start moving devices around, that could theoretically break.

However, I don't really see any obvious problems with your proposal
that we simply leave the memory enable bit in the hand-off state.

Once the OS is running and drivers are attached to devices, any
reshuffling of resources for those devices would require coordination
of the driver to release the resources and reprogram them.  Even if an
atomic update of the BAR were possible, that can't account for possible
in-flight use cases, such as p2p DMA.

There were a couple sessions from the 2019 Linux Plumbers conference
that might be useful to review regarding these issues.  IIRC the
first[1] was specifically looking at whether we could do partial BAR
allocations for NVMe devices, where we might have functionality but
reduced performance or features with a partial mapping.  In your
example, perhaps we're replacing a device with one that has twice the
BAR space, but is functional with only half that, so we can slide it
into the same slot as the previous device.  This would likely mean
enlightening the PCI core with device or class specific information.
I've not followed whether anything occurred here.

The second[2] (next session, same recording) discusses problems around
resource allocation and dynamic reallocation.  Again, I haven't
followed further discussions here, but I don't expect much has changed.
Thanks,

Alex
