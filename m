Hi, just wanted to update you I did some stupid mistake when I did the 
UEFI setup test (that's why I could not boot my Win10).

I suggest we will abandon this patch, and try to keep going on the QEMU 
VMBus patchset.

And perhaps submit a very basic patch to SeaBIOS and EDK2 which just 
enable SCONTROL.

Does that sound like a good plan to you?

Thanks,
-- Jon.
