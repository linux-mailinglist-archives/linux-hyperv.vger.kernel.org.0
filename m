That is very fuzzy in terms of hotplug memory.  The kexec'd kernel
should see the hotplugged memory assuming it is ordinary memory.

But kexec is not a reboot although it is quite similar.   Kexec is
swapping one running kernel and it's state for another kernel without
rebooting.

I think I am.

My challenge is that I don't see anything in the description that says
this isn't about ordinary hotplugged DIMMs.  All I saw was hotplug
memory.

If the class of memory is different then please by all means let's mark
it differently in struct resource so everyone knows it is different.
But that difference needs to be more than hotplug.

That difference needs to be the hypervisor loaned us memory and might
take it back at any time, or this memory is persistent and so it has
these different characteristics so don't use it as ordinary ram.

That information is also useful to other people looking at the system
and seeing what is going on.

Just please don't muddle the concepts, or assume that whatever subset of
hotplug memory you are dealing with is the only subset.

I didn't see that flag making the distinction about the kind of memory
it is.
