But you see, that's exactly what the kernel already does with the normal
permissions. They get set to RX after init and are never changed.

See the previous patch, we establish a read-write alias and write there.

You seem to lack basic understanding of how the kernel works in this
regard, which makes me very nervous about you touching any of this.

I must also say I really dislike your extra/random permssion calls all
over the place. They don't really get us anything afaict. Why can't you
plumb into the existing set_memory_*() family?
