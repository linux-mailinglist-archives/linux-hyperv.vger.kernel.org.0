Doesn't this work already?

I might be misinterpreting the spec, but my understanding is that
SCONTROL {en,dis}ables the message queueing completely.  What the quoted
part means is that a write to EOM should trigger the message source to
push a new message into the slot, regardless of whether the SINT was
masked or not.

And this (I think, haven't tested) should already work.  The userspace
just keeps using the SINT route as it normally does, posting
notifications to the corresponding irqfd when posting a message, and
waiting on the resamplerfd for the message slot to become free.  If the
SINT is masked KVM will skip injecting the interrupt, that's it.
