A notifier block like this makes sense, but why tie onto the PM_ stuff?
This isn't power management issues, it's a system-wide change that I am
sure others will want to know about that doesn't reflect any power
changes.

As much as I hate adding new notifiers in the kernel, that might be all
you need here.
