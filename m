Alright. I'm going to email a more serious patch for that in the next
few hours and you can have a look. Let's do that for 5.19.

Seems tricky to solve. Even a count of current waiters and a
generation number won't be sufficient, since it wouldn't take into
account users who haven't _yet_ gotten to waiting. But maybe it's not
the right problem to solve? Or somehow not necessary? For example, if
the problem is a bit more constrained a solution becomes easier: you
have a fixed/known set of readers that you know about, and you
guarantee that they're all waiting before the fork. Then after the
fork, they all do something to alert you in their poll()er, and you
count up how many alerts you get until it matches the number of
expected waiters. Would that work? It seems like anything more general
than that is just butting heads with the racy compromise we're already
making.

Jason
