I realise in retrospect this is not clear, but when I said "assembly
functions" I had meant raw assembly functions rather than inline
assembly.

We already have __arm_smccc_smc and __arm_smccc_hvc assembly functions
in arch/{arm,arm64}/kernel/smccc-call.S, and I'd expected we'd add the
full fat SMCCCv1.2 variants there.

Thanks,
Mark.
