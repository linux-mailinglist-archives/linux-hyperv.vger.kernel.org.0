(sorry for my persistence but I still believe there are issues which we
won't be able to solve if we take the suggested approach).

You got me. Indeed, "vmx-tsc-scaling" feature is indeed not set for
named CPU models so my example was flawed. Let's swap it with
VMX_VM_ENTRY_LOAD_IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL /
VMX_VM_EXIT_LOAD_IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL which a bunch of named models
have. So I do the same,

'-cpu CascadeLake-Sever,hv-evmcs'

on both the source host which knows about these eVMCS fields and the
destination host which doesn't.

First problem: CPUID. On the source host, we will have
CPUID.0x4000000A.EBX BIT(0) = 1, and "=0" on the destination. I don't
think we migrate CPUID data (can be wrong, though).

Second, assuming VMX feature MSRs are actually migrated, we must fail on
the destnation because VMX_VM_{ENTRY,EXIT}_LOAD_IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL is
trying to get set. We can do this in KVM but note: currently, KVM
filters guest reads but not host's so when you're trying to migrate from
a non-fixed KVM, VMX_VM_{ENTRY,EXIT}_LOAD_IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL are
actually present! So how do we distinguinsh in KVM between these two
cases, i.e. how do we know if
VMX_VM_{ENTRY,EXIT}_LOAD_IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL were filtered out on the
source (old kvm) or not (new KVM)?

I completely agree that what I'm trying to achieve here could've been
done in QEMU from day 1 but we now have what we have: KVM silently
filtering out certain VMX features and zero indication to userspace
VMM whether filtering is being done or not (besides this
CPUID.0x4000000A.EBX BIT(0) bit but I'm not even sure we analyze
source's CPUID data upon migration).

Out of curiosity, what happens if someone sends the following patch to
QEMU:

diff --git a/target/i386/cpu.c b/target/i386/cpu.c

Will Paolo remember about eVMCS and reject it?

The update at hand comes with a feature bit so no mater what we do, we
will need a new QEMU flag to support this feature bit. My suggestion was
just that we stretch its definition a bit and encode not only
PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL but all fields which were added. At the same time we
can switch to filtering host reads and failing host writes for what's
missing (and to do so we'll likely need to invert the logic and
explicitly list what eVMCS supports) so we're better prepared to the
next update.
