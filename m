I'm talking about the driver proposed here.  It can only be used in a
mode that taints the kernel that its running on, so why would we sign
up to support 400 lines of code that has no safe way to use it?

But this doesn't re-use the vfio-pci API at all, it explicitly defines
a new vfio-vmbus API over the vfio interfaces.  So a user mode driver
might be able to reuse some vfio support, but I don't see how this has
anything to do with PCI.

Which is what makes it unsupportable and prompts the question why it
should be included in the mainline kernel as it introduces a
maintenance burden and normalizes a usage model that's unsafe.  Thanks,

Alex
