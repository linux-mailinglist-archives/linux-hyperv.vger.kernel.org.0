I'll make sure to formalize this for whenever I post a full series, I
need to go over every hcall and think from that perspective.

There are some rules it might make sense to enforce. But it really
depends on the abstractions we settle on. KVM might not have the
necessary introspection to enforce them. IMO ideally it wouldn't, VTLs
should remain a user-space concept. My approach so far has been trusting
QEMU is doing the right thing.

Some high level examples come to mind:
 - Only one VTL vCPU might run at all times.
 - Privileged VTL interrupts have precedence over lower VTL execution.
 - lAPICs can only access their VTL. (Cross VTL IPIs happen through the
   PV interface).
 - Lower VTL state should be up to date when accessed from privileged
   VTLs (through the GET/SET_VP_REGSITER hcall).

Very interesting idea! I'll spend some time researching it, it sure
solves a lot of issues.

Correct. Only through kvm_hv_send_ipi(), but from experience it happens
very rarely, so performance shouldn't be critical.

I'll look into it.

ugh, that's a tired last minute "cleanup" that went south... It's been
working as intended for a while otherwise. I'll implement a
kvm-unit-test to redeem myself. :)
