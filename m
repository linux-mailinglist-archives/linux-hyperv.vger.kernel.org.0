It makes the callers slightly more readable, not having to cast to uint32_=

I did ponder defining a new struct with bitfields named along the lines of=
 'msi_addr_bits_19_to_4', but that seemed like overkill=2E

It's got a four-line comment right there after it as we use the bits we go=

Crap=2E Sure, want to look at the I/OAPIC and MSI documentation and observ=
e that it's just shifting bits around and "these bits go there, those bits =
go here=2E=2E=2E" but there's no magic which will make that go away=2E At s=
ome point you end up swizzling bits around with seemingly random bitmasks a=
nd shifts which you have to have worked out from the docs=2E

Now that I killed off the various IOMMU bits which also horrifically touch=
 the RTE directly, perhaps there is more scope for faffing around with it d=
ifferently, but it won't really change much=2E It's just urinating into the=
 atmospheric disturbance=2E

Well yes, there's a lot about the I/OAPIC code which is a bit horrid but t=
his patch is doing just one thing: making the bits get from e=2Eg=2E cfg->d=
est_apicid and cfg->vector into the RTE in a generic fashion which does the=
 right thing for IR too=2E Other cleanups are somewhat orthogonal, but yes =
it's a good spot that one of these was somewhat redundant in the first plac=
e=2E We could fix that up in a separate patch which comes first perhaps=2E

If we're starting to clean up I/OAPIC code I'd like to take a long hard lo=
ok at the level ack code paths, and the fact that we have separate ack_apic=
_irq and apic_ack_irq functions (or something like that; on phone now) whic=
h do different things=2E Perhaps the order (or the capitals on APIC which o=
ne of them has) makes it sane and meaningful for them both to exist and do =
different things?

I also note the Hyper-V "remapping" takes the IR code path and I'm not sur=
e that's OK=2E Because of the complete lack of overall documentation on wha=
t it's all doing and why=2E
