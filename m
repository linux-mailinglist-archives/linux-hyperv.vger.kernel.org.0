Agree, it really shouldn't be. The original developers hoped that
VFIO and VFIO-noiommu would replace it. But since DPDK has to run
on ancient distro's and other non VFIO hardware it still lives.

Because it is not suitable for merging for many reasons.
Mostly because it allows MSI and other don't want that.

It should taint in same way as VFIO with noiommu.
Yes it is documented as unsafe (but not in kernel source).
It really has same unsafeness as uio_pci_generic, and there is not warnings
around that.

Doing vIOMMU at scale with a non-Linux host, take a a long time.
Tainting doesn't make it happen any sooner. It just makes users
live harder. Sorry blaming the user and giving a bad experience doesn't help anyone.

The use case for all this stuff has been dedicated infrastructure.
It would be good if security was more baked in but it isn't.
Most users cover it over by either being dedicated applicances
or use LSM to protect UIO.
