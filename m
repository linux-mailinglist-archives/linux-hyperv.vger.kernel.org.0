Hardware-based CoCo is completely out of scope, because KVM has zero visibi=
lity
into the guest (well, SNP technically allows trapping CR0/CR4, but KVM real=
ly
shouldn't intercept CR0/CR4 for SNP guests).

And more importantly, _KVM_ doesn't define any policies for CoCo VMs.  KVM =
might
help enforce policies that are defined by hardware/firmware, but KVM doesn'=
t
define any of its own.

If pKVM on x86 comes along, then KVM will likely get in the business of def=
ining
policy, but until that happens, KVM needs to stay firmly out of the picture=
.

No?  Maybe?  I strongly suspect that full support will need a richer set of=
 APIs
than a single hypercall.  E.g. to handle kexec(), suspend+resume, emulated =
SMM,
and so on and so forth.  And that's just for CR pinning.

And hypercalls are hampered by the fact that VMCALL/VMMCALL don't allow for
delegation or restriction, i.e. there's no way for the guest to communicate=
 to
the hypervisor that a less privileged component is allowed to perform some =
action,
nor is there a way for the guest to say some chunk of CPL0 code *isn't* all=
owed
to request transition.  Delegation and restriction all has to be done out-o=
f-band.

It'd probably be more annoying to setup initially, but I think a synthetic =
device
with an MMIO-based interface would be more powerful and flexible in the lon=
g run.
Then userspace can evolve without needing to wait for KVM to catch up.

Actually, potential bad/crazy idea.  Why does the _host_ need to define pol=
icy?
Linux already knows what assets it wants to (un)protect and when.  What's m=
issing
is a way for the guest kernel to effectively deprivilege and re-authenticat=
e
itself as needed.  We've been tossing around the idea of paired VMs+vCPUs t=
o
support VTLs and SEV's VMPLs, what if we usurped/piggybacked those ideas, w=
ith a
bit of pKVM mixed in?

Borrowing VTL terminology, where VTL0 is the least privileged, userspace la=
unches
the VM at VTL0.  At some point, the guest triggers the deprivileging sequen=
ce and
userspace creates VTL1.  Userpace also provides a way for VTL0 restrict acc=
ess to
its memory, e.g. to effectively make the page tables for the kernel's direc=
t map
writable only from VTL1, to make kernel text RO (or XO), etc.  And VTL0 cou=
ld then
also completely remove its access to code that changes CR0/CR4.

It would obviously require a _lot_ more upfront work, e.g. to isolate the k=
ernel
text that modifies CR0/CR4 so that it can be removed from VTL0, but that sh=
ould
be doable with annotations, e.g. tag relevant functions with __magic or wha=
tever,
throw them in a dedicated section, and then free/protect the section(s) at =
the
appropriate time.

KVM would likely need to provide the ability to switch VTLs (or whatever th=
ey get
called), and host userspace would need to provide a decent amount of the ba=
ckend
mechanisms and "core" policies, e.g. to manage VTL0 memory, teardown (turn =
off?)
VTL1 on kexec(), etc.  But everything else could live in the guest kernel i=
tself.
E.g. to have CR pinning play nice with kexec(), toss the relevant kexec() c=
ode into
VTL1.  That way VTL1 can verify the kexec() target and tear itself down bef=
ore
jumping into the new kernel.=20

This is very off the cuff and have-wavy, e.g. I don't have much of an idea =
what
it would take to harden kernel text patching, but keeping the policy in the=
 guest
seems like it'd make everything more tractable than trying to define an ABI
between Linux and a VMM that is rich and flexible enough to support all the
fancy things Linux does (and will do in the future).

Am I crazy?  Or maybe reinventing whatever that McAfee thing was that led t=
o
Intel implementing EPTP switching?
