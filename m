The KVM APIs are good enough to cover guest life cycle management. To
make MSHV another implementation of the KVM APIs, we essentially need to
massage the data structures both way.

They are There is also an aspect for controlling the hypervisor that
affect the whole virtualization system. KVM APIs don't handle those. We
would need /dev/mshv for that purpose alone.

There is another aspect for Microsoft Hypervisor specific features and
enhancements, which aren't applicable to KVM. Features make sense for a
specific type-1 hypervisor may not make sense for KVM (a type-2
hypervisor). We have no intention to pollute KVM APIs with those. 

All in all the latter two points make /dev/mshv is a more viable route
in the long run.
