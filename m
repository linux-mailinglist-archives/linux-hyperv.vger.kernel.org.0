Dear Friend,

My name is Mr. Ibrahim Abdoul. If the content of this message is 
contrary to your moral ethics, please accept my apology. But, please 
treat with absolute secrecy. I am working with one of the prime banks in 
Burkina Faso. Here in this bank existed a dormant account for many 
years, which belong to one of our late foreign customer. The amount in 
this account stands at $13,300,000.00 (Thirteen Million Three Hundred 
Thousand US Dollars).

I was very fortunate to come across the deceased customer's security 
file during documentation of old and abandoned customerâ€™s files for an 
official documentation and audit of the year 2020.

I want a foreign account where the bank will transfer this fund. I know 
you would be surprised to read this message, especially from someone 
relatively unknown to you. But, do not worry yourself so much. This is a 
genuine, risk free and legal business transaction. All details shall be 
sent to you once I hear from you.

If you are really sure of your sincerity, trustworthiness, 
accountability and confidentiality over this transaction, reply back to 
me urgently. cantact me on (mr.ibrahimabdoul2020@gmail.com)

Best regards,

Mr. Ibrahim Abdoul
