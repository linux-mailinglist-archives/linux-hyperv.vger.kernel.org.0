I did something like this in the meantime, because all of this just
sucks.

Yes, we can't avoid the bit swizzling at all. But it can be made more
readable.

Well, you can look at it this way, but I surely have better things to do
than taking pencil and paper and drawing up mappings when reading
through that code or a patch against it.

Yes, that code is horrid, but adding a comment to that effect when
changing it is not asked too much, right?

The naming conventions are definitely not sane.

I stared into that today as well. There is a fundamental difference
between real hardware remapping and this.

Especially the affinity setting mode changes with remapping and hyper-v
goes into the remap path, but that hyperv driver does not issue
"irq_set_status_flags(virq, IRQ_MOVE_PCNTXT)", which means that you
can't change the affinity of the I/O-APIC interrupts in that hyperv mode
at all.

If that flag is not set then affinity changes are done in actual
interrupt context in ioapic_ack_level() which is only used for the
non-IR chip ...

I'm still wrapping my head around getting rid of this thing completely
because now it's just a subset of your KVM case with the only
restriction that I/O-APIC cannot be affined to any CPU with a APIC id
greater than 255.

Thanks,
