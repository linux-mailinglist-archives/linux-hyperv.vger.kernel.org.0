Noted.

My bad.
The logs, which I referred to here, was actually ftrace logs, for 
different channels offer, request for offer and all offers delivered 
event. My observation was then based on how these works are processed in 
workqueues. I was observing that all offers delivered event was being 
processed before channel offers. This was misleading, and sorry for the 
confusion.

Dexuan has responded to this query.

Understood, will remove it. Thanks.
