Sorry if "dividing up the initial SWIOTLB allocation" somehow sounded 
like "making multiple separate SWIOTLB allocations all over the place"?

I don't see there being any *functional* difference in whether a slice 
of the overall SWIOTLB memory is represented by 
"io_tlb_default_mem->areas[i]->blah" or "io_tlb_default_mem[i]->blah", 
I'm simply advocating for not churning the already-complex allocator 
internals by pushing the new complexity out to the margins instead.

Thanks,
Robin.
