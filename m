Hi Michael,

Great; thanks for this!

My main concern here is making sure that we can rely on architected
properties, and don't have to special-case architected bits for hyperv
(or any other hypervisor), since that inevitably causes longer-term
pain.

While in abstract I'm not as worried about using the timer
clock_event_device specifically, that same driver provides the
clocksource and the event stream, and I want those to work as usual,
without being tied into the hyperv code. IIUC that will require some
work, since the driver won't register if the GTDT is missing timer
interrupts (or if there is no GTDT).

I think it really depends on what that looks like.

Thanks,
Mark.
