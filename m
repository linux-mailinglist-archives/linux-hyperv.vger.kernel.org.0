OK, this really sucks. Quoting the ACPI spec:

"""
A _HID object evaluates to either a numeric 32-bit compressed EISA
type ID or a string. If a string, the format must be an alphanumeric
PNP or ACPI ID with no asterisk or other leading characters.
A valid PNP ID must be of the form "AAA####" where A is an uppercase
letter and # is a hex digit.
A valid ACPI ID must be of the form "NNNN####" where N is an uppercase
letter or a digit ('0'-'9') and # is a hex digit. This specification
reserves the string "ACPI" for use only with devices defined herein.
It further reserves all strings representing 4 HEX digits for
exclusive use with PCI-assigned Vendor IDs.
"""

So now we have to implement Microsoft's fork of ACPI to be able to use
this device, even if we expose it from QEMU instead of Hyper-V? I
strongly object to that.

Instead, we can match on _HID exposed by QEMU, and cordially invite
Microsoft to align their spec with the ACPI spec.
