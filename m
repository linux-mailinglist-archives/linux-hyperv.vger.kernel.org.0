Right. Injecting #UD/#GP/returning an error (?) might be desirable but the L2 guest
would still not be guaranteed to be able to rely on the functionality provided by
these TDCALLS. Here the TDCALLs lead to guest termination, but the kernel would panic
if some of them would return an error.

That is correct. The L1 hypervisor here (it's not hyperv, so maybe lets keep
referring to it as paravisor?) enables ENABLE_TDVMCALL so that TDVMCALLs exit
straight to L0. The TDVMCALLs are used for the I/O path which is not emulated
or intercepted by the L1 hypervisor at all.

Right, the only way to know whether TDVMCALL/TDCALL is allowed is to identify the
L1 hypervisor and use that knowledge.

When you say "normal VM" you mean "legacy VM"? 'Any TDX guest L1 hypervisor' is
a bit of a reach: the only TDX guest L1 hypervisor implementation that I know
exists does not support guests that are entirely unaware of TDX.

Maybe it's best if we avoid the name "TDX guest L1 hypervisor" altogether and
refer to is like AMD calls it: "Secure VM Service Module" because that more
accurately reflects the intention: providing certain targeted services needed in
the context of a confidential VM. No one is interested in running a full blown
hypervisor implementation in there.

I think on the whole we are on the same page. Let me rephrase what I hear you saying:
'tdx_partitioning_active' as a "catch all" is bad, but CC_ATTR_TDX_MODULE_CALLS is in
the spirit of what we would like to have.

So something like:


    case CC_ATTR_TDX_MODULE_CALLS:
        return tdx_status & TDCALL;

and 

    if (no_td_partitioning)
        tdx_status |= TDCALL;
    if (l1_td_vmm_supports_tdcalls)
        tdx_status |= TDCALL;

would be ok? I can directly tell you that the next facility would control tdx_safe_halt()
because that doesn't operate as intended (hlt traps to L1, tdx_safe_halt is a TDVMCALL and
goes to L0).

The other important goal of the patchset is ensuring that X86_FEATURE_TDX_GUEST is set.
