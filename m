Basically when I built the BIOS from the hv-scsi branch you pointed me 
out to, the BIOS did not see the virtio-blk device to boot from, I 
usually take the BIOS from (https://www.kraxel.org/repos/) but I will 
try to build the latest EDK2 and see if it identifies the virtio-blk 
device and boots from it, if that's the case perhaps i just need to 
rebase your branch over the latest master of EDK2.

The reason I want to have the UEFI option is because I need SecureBoot 
to turn on VBS.

Heh I see, well I'm really happy that you are here helping so we can try 
and finally add VMBus to QEMU, I realize it's a big effort but I'm 
willing to spend the time and do the required changes...

I'm working this only during my free time so things takes me longer than 
usual (sorry for that..)

I will keep update on results once I get to test with latest EDK2 :) 

Thanks,
