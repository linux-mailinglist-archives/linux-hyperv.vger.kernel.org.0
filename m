healthy? This is to inform you that i have concluded the transaction
successfully with the help of a new partner from Venezuela and now the

new partner.

Meanwhile, I have decided to compensate you with the sum of
US$350,000.00 (thiree Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States

decided to compensate you with the sum of US$350,000.00 so that you
will share the joy with me.

I advise you to contact my secretary for Atm Card of US$350.000.00,
which I kept for you. Contact him now without any delay.
