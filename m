No, you could in fact do this, and there'd be nothing wrong with that
from a spec perspective. You could even vDSO it all the way through
onward to userspace. However, doing a 16-byte atomic memcmp on
each-and-every packet is really a non-starter. For that kind of "check
it in the hot path" thing to be viable, you really want it to be a
counter that is word-sized. The "pull"-model involves pulling on every
single packet in order to be better than the "push"-model. Anyway, even
with a word-sized counter, it's unclear whether the costs of checking on
every packet would be worth it to everyone, but at least it's more
tenable than a 16-byte whammy.
