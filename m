Marc (and Mark) --

In our early interactions about the Hyper-V clocks and timers, the code
was a bit spread out, and you suggested moving all the clocksource
and clockevent stuff to a driver under drivers/clocksource.  See
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/e0374a07-809c-cabd-2eb6-e6b5ad84742e@arm.com/.
That was a good change independent of any ARM64 considerations,
but I read (or perhaps overread) your comments to say that it was OK
to use these Hyper-V para-virtualized clocks/timers instead of the ARM64
architectural ones in a Hyper-V VM.  They work and it's what the Hyper-V
guys wanted to do anyway, so having Hyper-V offer the ARM64 arch
counter and timer in a VM hasn't been a priority.  They had other stuff tha=
t
didn't work at all on ARM64, so that's where their attention went.

I agree that it would be better to have the ARM64 arch counter/timer
fully implemented in a Hyper-V VM.  But we're wanting to find a practical
way to move forward, and in doing so confine any rough edges to Hyper-V
VMs and the Hyper-V specific code in the kernel tree. We're maintaining
and shipping the code out-of-tree based on Hyper-V ARM64 current behavior
and would like to get this core enablement code upstream. Sure, unbinding
the Hyper-V clockevent doesn't work, but that's not a problem in any use
cases we see from customers.

All that said, our discussions with the Hyper-V team are continuing.  We're
still in the process of seeing what's practical to get and when.
