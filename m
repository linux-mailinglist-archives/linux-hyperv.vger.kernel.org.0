Yes you do need both of these.

Who sets up the message page then?  Doesn't it enabe SCONTROL as well?

Note that, even if you don't see it being enabled by Windows, it can be
enabled by the firmware and/or by the bootloader.

Can you perhaps try with the SeaBIOS from
https://src.openvz.org/projects/UP/repos/seabios branch hv-scsi?  It
enables SCONTROL and leaves it that way.

I'd also suggest tracing kvm_msr events (both reads and writes) for
SCONTROL and SIMP msrs, to better understand the picture.

So far the change you propose appears too heavy to work around the
problem of disabled SCONTROL.  You seem to be better off just making
sure it's enabled (either by the firmware or slighly violating the spec
and initializing to enabled from the start), and sticking to the
existing infrastructure for posting messages.

I'll look through the archive, should be there, thanks.
