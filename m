You actually do want to online in most cases, except, for example,
s390x. There might be weird cases with PFN-mapping offline memory into
VMs, but that is really a corner case when it comes to hotplugging memory.

However, "how" you want to online memory (normal/movable) depends on the
use case, the hotplug mechanism, and other factors (e.g., how much
memory will we hotplug, what are the system demands regarding
normal/movable memory, ...).

Hyperv-balloon just wants to online memory "normal", so not to
ZONE_MOVABLE. CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG_DEFAULT_ONLINE should get the job done.

I was working on a systemd unit to just configure memory onlining
semi-automatically, avoiding udev rules and to just configure
auto-onlining in the kernel during system boot.

Delaying memory onlining due to udev rules is a known issue when it
comes to hotplugging a lot of memory via hyperv balloon. We want kernel
to be onlined as fast as possible, directly when adding it in the kernel.

I currently don't have the capacity to work on the systemd unit, but the
latest version resides at:

https://github.com/davidhildenbrand/systemd/tree/memoryhotplugd

The idea is to let the unit figure out what might be best to do in the
detected environment. In addition, the admin can adjust the
configure/fine-tune handling without messing with udev rules, kernel
parameters or the sysfs.

IIRC, even on s390x. It's different on RHEL, where we leave standby
memory under s390x offline via udev rules right now.

The semantics of standby memory as you would find under z/VM and LPAR is
different: the admin is supposed to online it on demand; until then,
it's supposed to stay offline. Onlining will trigger actual backing of
the VM with additional memory, so some weird form of on-demand memory
hotplug.

Yeah, that would be broken and nacked by me.

The would work, most probably also for s390x. I assume most s390x users
that run these distros (fedora, kali,...) most probably don't care about
standby memory at all, meaning, not even having the option available in
their LPARs/VMs.
