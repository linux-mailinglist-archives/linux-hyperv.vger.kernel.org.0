I think matching on the HIDs of two known existing implementations is
fine, as opposed to matching on the (broken) CID of any implementation
that claims to be compatible with it. And dumping random strings into
the _CID property doesn't mesh well with the ACPI spec either, which
is why we don't currently support it.

We could still check _DDN if we wanted to, but I don't think this is
necessary. Other implementations that want to target his driver
explicitly can always put VMGENID or QEMUVGID into the _CID.
