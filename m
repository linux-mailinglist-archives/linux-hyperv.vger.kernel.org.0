"L2" is the Intel terminology in TD-partitioning (see figure 11.2 in [1]),
but Azure uses it for the exact same thing as VMPLs in SEV-SNP. On the AMD
side the community is working on Coconut SVSM[2] and there was an AMD SVSM[3]
project before that, both of them have the same idea as the Azure paravisor.
SUSE, Red Hat, IBM and others are active in SVSM development, we've also started
contributing. I think this kind of usage will also appear on TDX soon.

I don't think we'll be seeing Windows XP TDX/SNP guests :)

The primary use case for the paravisor (/SVSM) is pretty common across the
the industry and projects that I shared: TPM emulation. Then comes the
other stuff: live migration, "trustlets", further device emulation. All this
inside the confidential boundary.

The challenge lies in navigating the Venn diagram of: standard guest,
TDX guest and SNP guest. Is a "guest" more "TDX" or more "Hyper-V" (or KVM/Vmware)?
Should the TDX (and SNP) code be extended with more knowledge of hypervisor
interfaces or should the hypervisor interfaces know more about TDX/SNP.

I'd love it if we all had some agreement on this. I posted these patches
based on suggestions that TDX guest-ness takes precedence.

I hear you, that's we've been making an effort to be more open about use cases
and capabilities along with patches. We also care about simplifying the code
to make it easier to follow the flows. I think the whole kernel has come
a long way since the first confidential guest patches were posted.
