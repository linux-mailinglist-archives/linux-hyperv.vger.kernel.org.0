can -> could. Elena suggested something similar in another mail. That might
make it possible to standardize future paravisor-like usecases, similar to
[1]. Not sure this alone would be enough.

L1 is responsible for "virtual trust levels" so it might want to service
software running at other trust levels (other L2).

Not when L1 is involved.

Reading TDX host support in KVM/Qemu it seems to rely on the MAP_GPA, and
I believe so does Hyper-V when the guest runs non-partitioned TDX.

So the spec may say one thing, but if all implementations do the MAP_GPA
then it becomes expected behavior. But we're digressing.

Exactly, you're confirming my point. Which is why L2 issues a hypervisor specific
hypercall on every page visibility change that will always be handled by L1.

When the L2 wants to perform a page conversion it needs to notify L1 of this so that it
can do its part managing the aliases. Without L1 involvement the conversion doesn't
happen. MAP_GPA is not suitable for this purpose as I've described and you've confirmed
above.

You can explore changes to TDVMCALL handling in the TDX module but I don't see any reason
this would be adopted, because a shared hypercall to control page visibility for SNP & TDX is
already part of Hyper-V ABI and works great for this purpose.

I understand that is how you would prefer it but, as we've established in these emails,
that doesn't work when the L1 paravisor provides services to the L2 with an L1 specific
protocol and TDVMCALLs are routed to L0 for performance reasons. It can't be done
transparently with TDX 1.5 calls alone and we already have TDX 1.5 deployed to users with
an upstream kernel.

Can you propose a way forward to enable X86_FEATURE_TDX_GUEST for this usecase? We're
talking about consolidating existing kernel TDX code here.

Not according to Intel engineers and users that I've talked to that are unhappy with this.
And also userspace lacks discoverability of tdx guest in /proc/cpuinfo.
