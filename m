Huch?

There is not lot's of nastiness.

Yes, but that's exactly the reason why I don't want to have whatever
mask name you chose to be directly exposed and want it to be part of the
irq domains because then you can express arbitrary per domain limits.

TLDR & HTF;

Multiqueue devices want to have at max 1 queue per CPU or if the device
has less queues than CPUs they want the queues to have a fixed
association to a set of CPUs.

At setup time this is established considering possible CPUs to handle
'physical' hotplug correctly.

If a queue has no online CPUs it cannot be started. If it's active and
the last CPU goes down then it's quiesced and stopped and the core code
shuts down the interrupt and does not move it to a still online CPU.

So with your hackery, we end up in a situation where we have a large
possible mask, but not all CPUs in that mask can be reached, which means
in a 1 queue per CPU scenario all unreachable CPUs would have
disfunctional queues.

So that spreading algorithm needs to know about this limitation.

We kinda have that, but not nicely abstracted. But we surely can and
should fix that.

No. We fix it proper and not by hacking around it.

It's not rocket science to fix that as the irq remapping code already
differentiates between the device types.
