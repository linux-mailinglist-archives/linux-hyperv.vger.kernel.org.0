What I was trying to find out was how that was allocated, as vmalloc()'d
pointers aren't legitimate to pass to virt_to_phys().

From scanning ahead to patch 5, I see that memory comes from kmalloc(),
and so it is legitimate to use virt_to_phys().


I see; and from patch 5 I see that memory come from kmalloc(), and will
therefore be part of the linear map, and so virt_to_phys() is
legitimate.

What I was asking here was how that memory was allocated. So long as
those are the only buffers used, this looks fine to me.

Thanks,
Mark.
