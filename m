Yeah, I have the same feeling that full remapping of CIDs is probably
adding complexity without clear benefit, unless it somehow helps us
with the nested-virt scenario to disambiguate L0/L1/L2 CID ranges ?
I've not thought the latter through to any great level of detail
though

Two options is sufficient if you want to control AF_VSOCK usage
and /dev/vhost-vsock usage as a pair. If you want to separately
control them though, it would push for three options - global,
local, and mixed. By mixed I mean AF_VSOCK in the NS can access
the global CID from the NS, but the NS can't associate the global
CID with a guest.

IOW, this breaks down like:

 * CID=N local - aka fully private

     Outside NS: Can associate outside CID=N with a guest.
                 AF_VSOCK permitted to access outside CID=N

     Inside NS: Can NOT associate outside CID=N with a guest
                Can associate inside CID=N with a guest
                AF_VSOCK forbidden to access outside CID=N
                AF_VSOCK permitted to access inside CID=N


 * CID=N mixed - aka partially shared

     Outside NS: Can associate outside CID=N with a guest.
                 AF_VSOCK permitted to access outside CID=N

     Inside NS: Can NOT associate outside CID=N with a guest
                AF_VSOCK permitted to access outside CID=N
                No inside CID=N concept


 * CID=N global - aka current historic behaviour

     Outside NS: Can associate outside CID=N with a guest.
                 AF_VSOCK permitted to access outside CID=N

     Inside NS: Can associate outside CID=N with a guest
                AF_VSOCK permitted to access outside CID=N
                No inside CID=N concept


I was thinking the 'mixed' mode might be useful if the outside NS wants
to retain control over setting up the association, but delegate to
processes in the inside NS for providing individual services to that
guest.  This means if the outside NS needs to restart the VM, there is
no race window in which the inside NS can grab the assocaition with the
CID

As for whether we need to control this per-CID, or a single setting
applying to all CID.

Consider that the host OS can be running one or more "service VMs" on
well known CIDs that can be leveraged from other NS, while those other
NS also run some  "end user VMs" that should be private to the NS.

IOW, the CIDs for the service VMs would need to be using "mixed"
policy, while the CIDs for the end user VMs would be "local".

With regards,
Daniel
