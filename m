I don't understand why - it is not clear from the commit log and the
code, please explain it since it is not obvious.

It is fine by me - I would not have written it this way but it does
not matter.

I suggested a bitmap for correctness - a slot number may include slots
that as far as I can read the code failed get_pcichild_slot().

It is not clear what this patch is doing in this loop, that's certain.

Ok understood.

Less error prone, not sure, see above - it is your code so you choose
but please explain this change better, it is not obvious.

I understand that - the question is why it is OK to ignore it in this
specific case.

Maybe adding a wrapper around hv_pci_bus_exit() can help, I am fine with
it, just trying to help.
