Hey, nice, we agree!  :)

I know there are other places in the kernel that would like to be
notified when they have been moved to another machine so that they can
do things like determine if the CPU functionality has changed (or not),
and perhaps do other types of device reconfiguration.  Right now the
kernel does not have any way of knowing this, so it makes sense that if
the platform (i.e. ACPI here) has a way of creating such a event, it
should and then we can start tieing in other subsystems to use it
as-needed.

thanks,
