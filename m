I'm coming from the HyperV spec, see the quote above.

We don't have that BIOS, but we have another BIOS which does the same
and is not proprietary.  Using it allows to do synic message posting
even with a non-compliant guest OS which doesn't properly enable
SCONTROL on its own.  (Note that there used to be no problem with this
so far, this must be specific to your use case.)

I'm failing to see why this is a stumbling block for the work you're
doing.

And I'm not convinced we need to work around a non-compliant guest with
kludges to KVM or QEMU (including back-compat stuff as that would change
the existing behavior), when the desired effect can be achieved with the
existing code.

Thanks,
Roman.
