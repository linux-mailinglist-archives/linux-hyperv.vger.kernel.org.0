Does the vmgenid spec (as-is) preclude the use of the 16-byte identifier
like this?

After all, once you locate the identifier via the ADDR object, you could
perhaps consult it every time you were about to touch the RNG. Perhaps
with the help of 16-byte atomic (?) operations, you could maintain a
copy of the identifier elsewhere, and detect (atomically, upon each RNG
access) whether the identifier has changed, without waiting for the Notify.

We'd require (or assume) the hypervisors to modify the identifier in
guest RAM before resuming execution of the guest. And we'd have to delay
RNG accesses in the guest kernel until after the vmgenid device -- or
its absence -- were discovered.

Just a random guesss.

Thanks
