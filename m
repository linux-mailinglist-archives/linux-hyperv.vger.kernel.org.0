But all of that holds true irrespetive of eVMCS.  If QEMU attempts to migrate a
nested guest from a KVM that supports TSC_SCALING to a KVM that doesn't support
TSC_SCALING, then TSC_SCALING is going to disappear and VM-Entry on the dest will
fail.  I.e. QEMU _must_ be able to detect the incompatibility and not attempt
the migration.  And with that code in place, QEMU doesn't need to do anything new
for eVMCS, it Just Works.

Again, this conundrum exists irrespective of eVMCS.  Properly solve the problem
for regular nVMX and eVMCS should naturally work.

Enumerating features via versions is such a bad API though, e.g. if there's a
bug with nested TSC_SCALING, userspace can't disable just nested TSC_SCALING
without everything else under the inscrutable "hv-evmcs-2022" being collateral
damage.
